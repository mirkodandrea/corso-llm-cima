This paper introduces the Recovery Gap Index (RGI), a composite indicator designed to assess the capacity of nations to recover from disasters.  The RGI combines components of the World Risk Index, the INFORM index and the Global Infrastructure Risk Model, integrating measures of exposure, vulnerability, coping capacity and adaptive capacity.  Applied globally, the index reveals marked disparities: high‑income countries in Europe and North America exhibit high resilience, whereas many countries in Africa and Asia face large recovery gaps due to weak health systems, limited social protection and insufficient infrastructure.  The authors discuss potential refinements to the index—such as including early‑warning systems, insurance coverage and the role of local communities—and advocate its use to guide investments and policy aimed at reducing post‑disaster recovery inequalities【268353487963260†L9-L32】.

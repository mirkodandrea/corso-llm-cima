The Pelagos Sanctuary in the north‑western Mediterranean is the only High‑Seas Marine Protected Area dedicated to the conservation of cetaceans.  This study uses data from multiple research organisations collected between 2008 and 2021 to assess the distribution of eight cetacean species and evaluate how well existing protected areas safeguard their winter habitats.  Comparison with NATURA 2000 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) shows that current SACs cover only a small fraction of the species’ core areas; encounter rates and species diversity are highest in French portions of the sanctuary, while Italian waters display lower biodiversity.  The authors argue that protection should be expanded farther offshore and call for coordinated transboundary management to ensure the effective conservation of cetaceans in the Pelagos Sanctuary【239323478258273†L23-L41】.

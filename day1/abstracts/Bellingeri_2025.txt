Variation in body size and morphology among bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Mediterranean Sea has prompted speculation about the presence of distinct coastal and offshore ecotypes.  To test this hypothesis, the authors analysed 4,919 individual sightings recorded between 2004 and 2019 by 43 research groups archived in the Intercet database.  Distribution patterns and movements were examined relative to the 200 m bathymetric contour, and social network analysis was used to investigate connectivity among subpopulations.  The results show that most dolphins inhabit the continental shelf and regularly move across depth zones; the connectivity network is highly cohesive, and no clear separation into pelagic and coastal units emerges.  The study concludes that Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins constitute a single, well‑connected population and that morphological differences likely reflect ecological plasticity rather than distinct ecotypes【432717630644771†L67-L88】.

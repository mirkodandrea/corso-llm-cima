IT‑SNOW is a serially complete and multi‑year snow reanalysis for Italy. The dataset includes daily maps of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), snow depth (HS), bulk‑snow density (RhoS) and liquid water content (Theta_W). Data are organized in monthly netCDF files providing time and latitude/longitude information for georeferencing. Units are HS (cm), SWE (mm water equivalent), RhoS (kg m⁻³) and Theta_W (%). The maps are instantaneous snapshots at 11 AM UTC, assumed to be representative values for the day. As the output of an operational chain employed in real‑world civil‑protection applications (S3M Italy), IT‑SNOW ingests input data from thousands of automatic weather stations, snow‑covered‑area maps from Sentinel‑2, MODIS and H‑SAF products, and maps of snow depth derived from the spatialisation of over 1000 on‑the‑ground snow‑depth sensors. Additional information is available in the related paper “IT‑SNOW: a snow reanalysis for Italy blending modeling, in‑situ data, and satellite observations (2009‑2021).” The dataset initially spans September 1 2010 to August 31 2021, with future updates envisaged on an annual basis.

Rainfall is the primary trigger of shallow landslides in Italy, yet regional‑scale forecasting remains challenging.  This study proposes a machine‑learning approach based on a polynomial kernel regularised least‑squares (KRLS) regression to predict the daily occurrence of rainfall‑induced landslides in five civil‑protection alert zones of the Liguria region.  Predictor variables include soil moisture, the total precipitation accumulated over the previous 12 hours and the peak 3‑hour rainfall intensity.  Model outputs are translated into four warning levels—green, yellow, orange and red—in accordance with regional legislation.  Cross‑validation shows that the KRLS model achieves an overall accuracy of 93 %, with F1 scores between 0.76 and 0.93 across the zones, substantially outperforming a persistence baseline.  The results demonstrate that the approach can be integrated into early‑warning systems and support hydrometeorological forecasting chains for landslide risk management【709686964297809†L14-L38】.

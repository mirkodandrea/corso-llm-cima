The Mediterranean Sea is a biodiversity hotspot but suffers from intense anthropogenic pressures, including marine litter and microplastics.  This study develops an integrated approach to assess how floating debris impacts marine megafauna and invertebrates within the Pelagos Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI).  Two complementary monitoring strategies are used: (1) spatial analyses of floating‑litter density overlapped with the core distribution areas of 23 species (cetaceans, sea turtles, sharks and seabirds), and (2) assessment of litter ingestion and plastic additives in stranded individuals and in invertebrates collected at sea.  By merging distribution and exposure data, the authors produce risk maps that identify the species most affected by marine litter and propose a set of sentinel taxa for monitoring the open‑water environment.  The results highlight the urgent need for targeted mitigation and conservation measures to protect Pelagos’ biodiversity【413163981071855†L332-L353】.

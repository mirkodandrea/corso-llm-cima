The Solutions Explorer is an open‑source web platform developed within the European ROADMAP and ROADMAP2 projects to collect, classify and disseminate good practices in disaster risk management.  Drawing on lessons learned from past events and expert interviews, the platform defines a ‘good practice’ as a documented solution that improves prevention, preparedness, response or recovery and can be transferred to other contexts.  The manual outlines the conceptual framework used to identify, evaluate and categorise practices, detailing criteria such as effectiveness, transferability and sustainability.  It also provides step‑by‑step guidance on how users can search for relevant solutions, upload new practices, and participate in peer review.  By making tried‑and‑tested measures easily accessible to civil‑protection stakeholders, the Solutions Explorer aims to strengthen the European civil protection knowledge network and support evidence‑based risk reduction【435573199716043†L88-L140】.

This paper compares three species‑distribution modelling frameworks—generalised additive models (GAMs), boosted regression trees (BRTs) and hurdle models—for assessing spatial and temporal changes in fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) distribution in the Mediterranean Sea.  Using presence–absence and count data from systematic surveys conducted between 2008 and 2022, the authors relate fin‑whale observations to environmental covariates including bathymetry, seabed slope, mixed‑layer depth, sea‑surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration.  All frameworks perform well at distinguishing presence from absence, but their ability to predict density patterns varies; bathymetry and slope are consistently identified as the most influential predictors, whereas chlorophyll contributes more weakly.  Logistic boosted regression trees provide the best overall predictive skill.  The study underscores the importance of choosing an appropriate modelling approach when informing conservation and management of wide‑ranging marine mammals【24091894537162†L10-L36】.

As the European continent and the Mediterranean Sea experience rapid warming trends and increasingly diverse manifestations of extreme weather, there is an urgent need to understand and mitigate climate‑change impacts in these regions. This study introduces the Computational Hydrometeorology with Advanced Performance to Enhanced Realism (CHAPTER) high‑resolution dynamical downscaling of the ECMWF ERA5 global reanalysis using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. CHAPTER covers Europe and the Mediterranean basin on a convection‑resolving 3 km × 3 km grid. Its ability to represent precipitation and temperature is evaluated relative to state‑of‑the‑art datasets such as ERA5‑Land. Seasonal spatial distributions of bias and root‑mean‑square error are analysed, and fuzzy verification techniques are applied to validate precipitation outputs. Results show that CHAPTER’s performance aligns closely with well‑recognized downscalings of ERA5 while additionally providing a rich portfolio of variables at hourly temporal resolution and on varying terrain following model levels. CHAPTER therefore offers a valuable resource for studying extreme weather events and provides insights crucial for climate‑change adaptation and mitigation efforts in Europe and the Mediterranean region.

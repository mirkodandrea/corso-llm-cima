This abstract presents a methodology for near‑real‑time flood monitoring using on‑demand synthetic‑aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from different viewing geometries.  Because emergency planners often rely on opportunistic SAR data during floods, the authors develop an automated change‑detection algorithm that remains robust when images have different incidence angles and orbits.  The procedure combines histogram equalization and clustering to normalize the input images, a fuzzy logic change‑detection operator, region growing and two electromagnetic models to segment flooded and dry pixels, and a post‑processing step that merges the multigeometry results into daily flood maps.  The methodology is tested on several 2023 floods in Emilia‑Romagna and Tuscany using COSMO‑SkyMed images; the resulting flood maps show F1 scores ranging from 0.76 to 0.90 when compared to ground‑truth data, demonstrating that reliable flood monitoring can be achieved even when SAR acquisitions come from non‑optimal geometries【819838629604977†L64-L96】.

This dataset provides urban climate data collected from seven weather stations in Torino, Italy, spanning 2014–2023. The ARPA Piemonte stations measure key meteorological variables—air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure and solar radiation. The data were originally recorded in CSV format and processed using Python to clean and merge variables, compute missing parameters (e.g., splitting global irradiation into its components) and generate an hourly dataset for each year. A Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) was then generated following ISO 15927‑4. Missing data points were estimated using interpolation and statistical methods to ensure completeness. Finally, the data were converted into EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) format using custom Python scripts. The resulting dataset serves as a crucial resource for urban climate studies and building energy simulations. It is particularly valuable for assessing urban heat‑island effects, generating accurate weather files for simulation purposes and refining design choices in urban planning. The data pipeline is transferable to other cities with weather stations and can be used for future updates for Torino.

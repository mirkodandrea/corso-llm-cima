Assessing how critical infrastructures will function during floods requires accounting for multiple interacting factors.  This article presents a fuzzy, indicator‑based methodology that integrates infrastructure susceptibility, exposure to hazards and network interdependencies to estimate the functional vulnerability of roads, bridges, schools and other assets.  Indicators—such as structural type, elevation, maintenance and redundancy—are combined using fuzzy logic to derive susceptibility scores, which are then multiplied by flood‑exposure levels in a susceptibility–exposure matrix.  The resulting functional vulnerability index enables the ranking of infrastructures according to their likelihood of failure during floods.  Application to the cities of Berat (Albania) and Sarajevo (Bosnia‑Herzegovina) reveals that vulnerability patterns differ between asset classes and locations; for example, schools in Berat are more exposed than bridges, whereas the opposite holds in Sarajevo.  The methodology provides decision‑makers with a transparent tool to prioritise resilience investments【8401649643108†L14-L35】.

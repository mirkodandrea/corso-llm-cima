Using data from 13 years of dedicated visual surveys (2008–2020) in the north‑western Mediterranean Sea, this study investigates the winter distribution and habitat preferences of eight cetacean species.  Generalised additive models indicate that static variables such as bathymetry and slope, together with dynamic variables like sea‑surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration, define the winter habitats of the species.  The analysis reveals that some areas within the Gulf of Lion and Ligurian Sea are used for feeding, while others serve as transit corridors, and that habitat associations vary among species.  The findings highlight the importance of the north‑western Mediterranean basin as a winter refuge for cetaceans and stress that conservation measures should consider both static and dynamic environmental drivers【972606692254177†L16-L34】.

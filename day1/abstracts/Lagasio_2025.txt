Weather forecasting is essential for agriculture, yet existing methods often lack the localized accuracy needed to manage extreme weather events and optimize irrigation. The MAGDA Horizon Europe/EUSPA project aims to fill this gap by developing a modular system that integrates novel space‑, air‑ and ground‑based European technologies. In contrast to conventional forecasting systems, MAGDA provides field‑level predictions by combining cutting‑edge technologies: Meteodrones supply vertical atmospheric profiles where traditional data are sparse; GNSS‑reflectometry yields real‑time soil‑moisture information; and all observations feed into convection‑permitting models for accurate nowcasting of extreme events. By combining satellite data, GNSS, Meteodrones and high‑resolution meteorological models, MAGDA enhances agricultural and water management with precise, tailored forecasts. Climate change is increasing the frequency of heavy rainfall, hail and droughts, threatening crop yields and water resources. Improving forecast reliability requires better observational data to refine initial atmospheric conditions. Recent advances in assimilating reflectivity and in situ observations into high‑resolution numerical weather models show promise, particularly for convective weather. Experiments using Sentinel and GNSS‑derived data have further improved severe‑weather prediction. MAGDA employs a high‑resolution cloud‑resolving model and integrates GNSS, radar, weather stations and Meteodrones to provide comprehensive atmospheric insights. These enhanced forecasts support irrigation management and extreme‑weather warnings through a Farm Management System that assists farmers. As climate change escalates floods and droughts, MAGDA’s integration of high‑resolution, multi‑source observational technologies—including GNSS‑reflectometry and drone‑based atmospheric profiling—is crucial for sustainable agriculture and efficient water‑resource management.

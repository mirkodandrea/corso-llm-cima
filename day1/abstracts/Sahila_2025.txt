Wildfire dynamics simulated using PROPAGATOR, a quasi‑empirical cellular automaton model, is studied by investigating the effects of wind–terrain interactions on the predicted burned‑area patterns. PROPAGATOR is coupled with WindNinja, a microscale wind simulator that computes spatially varying wind fields using a solver that conserves mass and another that also conserves momentum. Two historical fires are considered: one that occurred in quasi‑flat terrain in the Molise region of Italy, and another that ignited in the southern area of Avinyó in Spain. A standard fire simulator using only uniform wind fields and the version coupled with WindNinja’s solvers predict similar burning‑probability maps for the Campomarino fire because the wind pattern there is weakly affected by topography, causing only slight deviations from a uniform wind field during fire propagation. For the complex terrain of the Avinyó region, however, simulations incorporating spatially varying wind fields predict significantly different burned‑area shapes for long‑time regimes and intense winds, with secondary fire spots separated from the main burning zone. Larger spatial extension of the wildfire is observed when firefighters’ actions are absent, but the predicted patterns are similar regardless of wind‑field type and resolution. A ten‑fold increase in perturbation magnitude on wind direction contracts the predicted burned area for all probability thresholds, whereas two‑ and ten‑fold increases in wind‑speed perturbations lead to significantly larger burned areas and fire spread. Further quantitative analysis of how spatially varying wind fields influence the predictability of cellular‑automata models for megafires is still required.

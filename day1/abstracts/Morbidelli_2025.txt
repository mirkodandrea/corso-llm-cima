Rainfall records are essential for hydrological research, but their temporal resolution has varied over time as instrumentation and data‑logging technologies have evolved.  Early records were obtained manually or by mechanical gauges with coarse resolution, and high‑resolution digital measurements have only become widespread in the past four decades.  This study updates an earlier historical review by compiling a global database of 126,438 rain‑gauge stations across 77 geographical areas and evaluating how their time resolution has changed.  The authors find that while many networks now report rainfall measurements at sub‑hourly resolution, a large number of voluntary or civil‑protection stations still report only daily totals, limiting analyses of short‑duration events.  They encourage gauge operators to make high‑resolution records available to the scientific community and contribute to the Rainfall Resolutions Data repository【377098447619579†L128-L149】.
